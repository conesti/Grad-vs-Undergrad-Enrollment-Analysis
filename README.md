# Grad-vs-Undergrad-Enrollment-Analysis

Link to Rpub: http://rpubs.com/thrinacia/grad-vs-ugrad-spring-mixed-enrollment

This is a small project I worked on to compare the amount of undergraduates and graduates in each course that has a mixture of both student populations.  It is interesting because the data demonstrate some sort of shift in an equalizing manner from 2018 Spring to 2019 Spring.  The data is taken from the Harvard Registrar website, where enrollment statistics are posted.
